## Description

Headless Login for WPGraphQL is a flexible and extensible plugin that allows headless WordPress sites to login and authenticate users via <a href="https://wpgraphql.com" target="_blank">WPGraphQL</a> using a variety of authentication methods, including traditional WordPress username/password,<a href="https://oauth.net/2/" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0</a> / <a href="https://openid.net/connect/" target="_blank">OpenID Connect</a>, and <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank">JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</a>.

This plugin is inspired by and aims to replace <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-jwt-authentication" target="_blank">WPGraphQL JWT Authentication</a> as more powerful and flexible authentication solution for Headless WP.

## System Requirements

## Supported Features

* Use a traditional WordPress username/password using [the `loginWithPassword` mutation](./docs/mutations.md#login-with-a-traditional-wordpress-usernamepassword).
* Validate an OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect provider response using [the `login` mutation](./docs/mutations.md#login-with-an-oauth2openid-authorization-response).

	Supported providers (out of the box):
	* Facebook
	* GitHub
	* Google
	* Instagram
	* LinkedIn
	* OAuth2 - Generic: Any other OAuth 2.0 provider.
	* SAML authentication and more coming soon!

	Or add your own provider by [extending the `ProviderConfig` class](./docs/provider-config.md).
* Authenticate with JWT tokens using a [HTTP Authorization header](./docs/example-next-api-routes.md).
* Generate short-term `authToken`s and long term `refreshToken`s for seamless reauthentication in your headless app.
* Optionally link a user account to an OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect provider, or create a new WordPress user if none exists, with data mapped from the provider identity.
* Query the [enabled `loginClient` authorization urls](./docs/queries.md#querying-login-clients), to use in your frontend's login buttons.
* Extensive WordPress [actions](./docs/actions.md) and [filters](./docs/filters.md) for customization of the plugin's behavior.
* Log out all sessions for a user by [revoking](./docs/mutations.md#revoke-the-user-secret) or [refreshing](./docs/mutations.md#refresh-the-user-secret) their tokens, in GraphQL or the WordPress backend Profile Page.

- and more!
