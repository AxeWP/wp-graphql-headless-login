## Description

Headless Login for WPGraphQL is a flexible and extensible plugin that allows headless WordPress sites to login and authenticate users via <a href="https://wpgraphql.com" target="_blank">WPGraphQL</a> using a variety of authentication methods, including traditional WordPress credentials (username/password), <a href="https://oauth.net/2/" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0</a> / <a href="https://openid.net/connect/" target="_blank">OpenID Connect</a>, <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank">JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</a>, and more.

This plugin is inspired by and aims to replace <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-jwt-authentication" target="_blank">WPGraphQL JWT Authentication</a> as more powerful, comprehensive, and flexible authentication solution for Headless WP.

## Supported Features

The following functionality is currently supported:

- Authenticate with a [WordPress username and password](./docs/reference/mutations.md#login-with-a-traditional-username-password).

Supported providers (out of the box):
  * Facebook
  * GitHub
  * Google
  * Instagram

  * SAML authentication and more coming soon!
- Use a [special Site Token](./docs/reference/mutations.md#login-with-a-site-token-and-user-identity
) to support WordPress authentication with any  externalaly authenticated user identity (e.g. [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)).
- Add your own Authentication Provider by [extending the `ProviderConfig` class](./docs/recipes/provider-config.md).
- Authenticate with JWT tokens using a [HTTP Authorization header]().
- [Set CORS headers](./docs/reference/settings.md) to allow or restrict access to the GraphQL endpoint.
- Generate short-term `authToken`s and long term `refreshToken`s for seamless reauthentication in your headless app.
- [Link a user account](./docs/reference/mutations.md#manually-link-the-wordpress-user-to-a-providers-resource-owner) to an authentication provider's resource owner, to allow users to authenticate with multiple providers.
- Query the [enabled `loginClient` authorization urls](./docs/reference/queries.md#querying-login-clients), to use in your frontend's login buttons.
- Extensive WordPress [actions](./docs/actions.md) and [filters](./docs/reference/filters.md) for customization of the plugin's behavior.
- Log out all sessions for a user by [revoking](./docs/reference/mutations.md#revoke-the-user-secret) or [refreshing](./docs/reference/mutations.md#refresh-the-user-secret) their tokens, in GraphQL or the WordPress backend Profile Page.
- Manage WooCommerce Sessions with [WPGraphQL for WooCommerce](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce).
